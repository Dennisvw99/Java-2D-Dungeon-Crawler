# Java-2D-Dungeon-Crawler

Explorer is a Java-2D-Dungeon-Crawler based game.
The idea of the game is essentially simple. The user is a character which he can move through a 2D map while picking up items.
There is no real mission you need to succeed, nor it is challanging. The purpose of this little game is just to get through the time of your everyday life. It's great for someone who is bored and just wants to do something that doesn't require him or her to think.
